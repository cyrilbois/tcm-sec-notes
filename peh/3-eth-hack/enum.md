- Import `Kioptrix.ova`
  - set RAM to `256MB` or `512MB` 
  - set the VM Network Adapter to `NAT`, the same `NAT` network of the **Kali VM**
  - run the virtual machine, select `Do nothing` if asked and let it boot to the login screen

## Nmap Scanning

From the **Kali VM**, find its network and user `netdiscover` to find the **Kioptrix VM** IP

- Tools for network discovery - `netdiscover`, `arp-scan`

```bash
# find Kali network
ip -br -c a
```

```bash
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.31.0/24
# run it again if no IP found

# or use
sudo arp-scan -l
```

```bash

‚û°Ô∏è [`nmap`](https://nmap.org/) - utility for network discovery and security auditing

```bash
nmap --help
```

```bash
# Scan everything and all ports
sudo nmap -T4 -p- -A 192.168.31.130

# Stealth scanning everything and all ports
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -p- -A 192.168.31.130
```

- Look for open sports and what is running on those ports

```bash

Look at the open ports and get all the details down by taking notes:

- `22` - ssh - OpenSSH 2.9p2 (protocol 1.99)
- `80` - http - Apache httpd 1.3.20
- `111` - rpcbind
- `139` - netbios-ssn Samba smbd
- `443` - ssl/https - Apache/1.3.20 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)
- OS details: `Linux 2.4.9` - 2.4.18 (likely embedded)

### Enumerating HTTP and HTTPS

- Navigate to the webpage at [http://192.168.31.130/](http://192.168.31.130/) and [https://192.168.31.130/](https://192.168.31.130/) (the IP will change based on the Kioptrix VM IP)

![](.gitbook/assets/2024-07-07_14-34-14_581-1720355665903-3.png)

**Architecture enumeration**

- runs Apache
- the VM (potentially) runs Red Hat Linux
- other web directories may be present (dir-busting)
- public default webpage - poor hygiene

**Information disclosure**

- Apache 1.3.20
